# Design Document - The Beginner's Kitchen

The Beginner's Kitchen is an organization that provides cooking instruction that also serves as a recipe website. The basic premise is a cooking website that features recipes, videos, and instructional texts on cooking concepts. The company also provides small group, face-to-face cooking instruction for people in specific metro areas.

The design of the website will focus primarily on basic, black and white styling intended to emphasize the quality of the food photos.

## Featured Pages

This Bootstrap website, based on the Modern Business template by Bootstrap, will feature the following pages:
1. Front Page (based on index.html), whih will contain a photo reel of food along with a collection of project photos.
2. About Page (based on about.html), featuring a series of photos of satisfied customers along with catchy quotes.
3. Contact Page (based on contact.html), which will have a contact form submission and a map.
4. Recipe Page (based on blog-home-1.html), featuring snippets of larger blog posts (recipes or similar) entries with associated photos.
5. Classes Page (based on services.html), which describes some of the cooking classes offered by the company.

## Websites of Comparable Businesses

These websites were used for reference, with respect to how cooking and recipe websites work. Several of them provided context for the actual aesthetic elements. In general, a lot of cooking websites tended to focus on relatively uncomplicated design in what can be assumed to be an effort to highlight the quality of the food photography.
1. **Alton Brown's Website** at https://altonbrown.com/.
2. **The Cooking Channel Website** at https://www.cookingchanneltv.com/.
3. **Maangchi** at https://www.maangchi.com/.
4. **Epicurious** at https://www.epicurious.com/.
5. **America's Test Kitchen Online Cooking School** at https://www.onlinecookingschool.com/.

Several of the above websites, including the Epicurious website and Alton Brown's website, feature an element of "design simplicity" that emphasizes the photos of food. Since the purpose of the website is to promote food, it seems an appropriate style to use as inspiration.

## Target Audience

As the name implies, this website is intended to target people who are interested in cooking but don't otherwise having the training or experience. In that regard, it is a beginner's cooking webesite. If I were to fill out the content, the recipes would focus on basic skills and techniques, guiding beginning chefs on how to slowly improve their skill.

**Demographic:**
1. Milennials and other young people.
2. College students or people without sufficient income to spend on cooking boxes or comparable.
**Motivations:**
1. Want to learn how to cook without any prior skill or experience.
2. Low cost techniques; not based on fancy kitchen devices or expensive classes.
